## Description
This repository contains the design files for Kitty Design, a small PCB project to create a light sequence. The board is powered by an inexpensive yet powerful PY32f002 microcontroller from the PUYA series. These low-power chips are efficient enough to be powered by a single coin cell battery (CR2032) for an extended period. This project was created for fun and as a practical exercise in using KiCad 9.
